# (Q - 15) : What are the external style sheets?

## External Style Sheets :
    - These style sheets are created separately from the HTML content and are linked to the HTML documents using the <link> element.
    - When using an external style sheet, you create a separate file with a .css extension that contains CSS code.
    - To link an external style sheet to an HTML document, you need to include a <link> element in the <head> section of the HTML document.
    - The <link> element specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the external style sheet. 

## Example :
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
    </html>

    - Wrapping all data into a single unit (ex : class).

### Inheritance: 
    - A mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class.

### Polymorphism:
    - The ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.

### Abstraction:
    - Concept of hiding private details and exposing only the essential features of object or function.

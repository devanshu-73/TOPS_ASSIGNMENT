# Negative indexes and their use

    - Negative indexes in Python are used to access elements from the end of a sequence. 
    - For example, -1 refers to the last element, -2 refers to the second-to-last element, and so on.
    - They are convenient when you need to access elements in reverse order or when the exact length of the sequence is unknown.

# (Q-5) : What are undeclared and undefined variables? 

## Undefined: 
    - It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. 
    - Undefined is not a keyword. 
## Example of Undefined :
    - let a;
      console.log(a) 
      Console gives Error like 'a' is undefined.

## Undeclared: 
    - It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or 
      sdeclared earlier using the var or const keyword. 
    - If we use ‘typeof’ operator to get the value of an undeclared variable, 
      we will face the runtime error with the return value as “undefined”.
    - The scope of the undeclared variables is always global. 

## Example of Undeclared: 

    - console.log(a) 
       //ReferenceError: a is not declared

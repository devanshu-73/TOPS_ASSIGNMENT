# (Q-1) :  What is JavaScript? 
    - JavaScript is a lightweight programming language that web developers commonly 
      use to create more dynamic interactions when developing web pages, applications, servers, and or even games.

    - Developers generally use JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS The scripting language
      works well with CSS in formatting HTML elements. However, JavaScript still maintains user interaction, something that CSS cannot do by itself.

      game development make the scripting language worth learning.

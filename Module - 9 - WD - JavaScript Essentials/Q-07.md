# (Q-7) : What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?

## Differences between ViewState and SessionState:

| ViewState                                                                 | SessionState                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maintained at page level only.                                            | Maintained at session level.                                                                                                             |
| View state can only be visible from a single page and not multiple pages. | Session state value availability is across all pages available in a user session.                                                        |
| It will retain values in the event of a postback operation occurring.     | In session state, user data remains in the server. Data is available to user until the browser is closed or there is session expiration. |
| Information is stored on the client’s end only.                           | Information is stored on the server.                                                                                                     |
| used to allow the persistence of page-instance-specific data.             | used for the persistence of user-specific data on the server’s end.                                                                      |
| ViewState values are lost/cleared when new page is loaded.                | SessionState can be cleared by programmer or user or in case of timeouts.                                                                |

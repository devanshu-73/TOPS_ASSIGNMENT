# (Q-3) :  What is negative Infinity?

    - The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value that is used to represent a value that is the lowest available. This means that no other number is lesser than this value. It can be generated using a self-made function or by an arithmetic operation. 

    - JavaScript shows the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity.

# Example : 
    let x = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY; 
    Output : -Infinity

### Negative infinity is different from mathematical infinity in the following ways:

    - Negative infinity results in -0(different from 0 ) when divided by 
      any other number.
    - When divided by itself or positive infinity, negative infinity return NaN
      Negative infinity, when divided by any positive number (apart from positive infinity) is negative infinity.
    - Negative infinity, divided by any negative number 
      (apart from negative   infinity) is positive infinity.
    - If we multiply negative infinity with NaN, we will get NaN as a result.
    - The product of 0 and negative infinity is Nan.
    - The product of two negative infinities is always a positive infinity.
    - The product of both positive and negative infinity is always negative infinity.

# (Q-01) What is Redux?

## Answer :

    - Redux is a popular state management library for React.js applications.
    - It helps manage the state of your application in a predictable and centralized manner, making it easier to manage and maintain complex application state.
    - Redux is often used in large and complex React applications to handle data flow and state changes

### Here are the core concepts of Redux:

    (1) Store: Redux maintains a single centralized store that holds the entire application's state. This store is typically an object tree that represents the current state of your application.

    (2) Actions: Actions are plain JavaScript objects that represent events or user interactions that can change the state of your application. Actions must have a type property that describes the type of action being performed.

    (3) Reducers: Reducers are pure functions that specify how the application's state should change in response to actions. They take the current state and an action as input and return a new state. Reducers are responsible for updating the store.

    (4) Dispatch: To trigger a state change, you dispatch an action to the Redux store using the store.dispatch(action) method. Redux will then call the appropriate reducer, and the state will be updated accordingly.

    (5) Subscribe: You can subscribe to changes in the Redux store using store.subscribe(listener). This allows your components to be notified whenever the state changes, so they can update their UI accordingly.

    (6) Middleware: Redux allows the use of middleware to handle side effects, such as asynchronous actions. Popular middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga can be used to manage complex asynchronous logic.

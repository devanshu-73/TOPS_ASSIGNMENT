# (Q-04) What is the second argument that can optionally be passed tosetState and what is its purpose?

## Answer :

    - The second argument that can optionally be passed to setState is a callback function which gets called immediately after the setState is completed and the components get re-rendered.

    - This callback function is useful when you want to perform certain actions on the updated value of state after updating it using setState. If you don’t specify this callback function, then those actions will be performed on the previous value of state due to the asynchronous nature of setState.

### example of how to use the second argument of setState:

    - this.setState({ name: value }, () => {
      console.log("Current name: " + this.state.name);
        });
        
    - In this example, we’re updating the value of name using setState and then logging its current value to the console using a callback function

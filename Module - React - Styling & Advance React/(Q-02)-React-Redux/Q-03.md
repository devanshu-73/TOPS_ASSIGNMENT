# (Q-03) What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component?

## Answer :

     -In React-Redux, which is an extension of React for managing state using the Redux library, the concepts of PureComponent and Component remain the same as in plain React. However, the decision to use PureComponent or Component in a React-Redux application is based on the same considerations I explained earlier, with some additional context related to state management with Redux.

### Performance Optimization:

    - In React-Redux, the choice between PureComponent and Component depends on whether you want to optimize the rendering performance of your components.

    - Use PureComponent when you want to optimize performance by automatically preventing unnecessary re-renders. This can be particularly useful for connected components that receive data from the Redux store as props. PureComponent can help reduce re-renders when the props from the Redux store haven't changed, as it performs a shallow comparison of the props.

    - Use Component when you don't need the automatic optimization provided by PureComponent or when you have specific use cases that require custom shouldComponentUpdate logic. For instance, if your component needs to perform deep comparisons or if it has custom logic for handling props received from Redux, you might opt for a regular Component with a manually implemented shouldComponentUpdate.

### Connected Components and Redux State:

    - In a React-Redux application, most of your components will likely be connected to the Redux store using the connect function from the react-redux library. Whether you use PureComponent or Component depends on how you handle Redux state in your connected components.

    - Use PureComponent for Connected Components: If your connected component's render output depends solely on the props it receives from the Redux store and you want to optimize re-renders based on prop changes, you can use PureComponent. It will automatically perform shallow comparisons on the props received from Redux.

    - Use Component with Care for Complex Logic: If your connected component performs complex logic that involves deep comparisons, asynchronous operations, or if it depends on a combination of Redux state and local state, you might need to use a regular Component. In this case, you can implement custom shouldComponentUpdate logic to determine when the component should update

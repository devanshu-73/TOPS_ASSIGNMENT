# (Q-16) : How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?

    - In JavaScript, we can use window.location object to force a page to load another page.
    - We can use the location object to set the URL of a new page.
    - There are different ways â€“ window.location.href property, window.location.assign() and window.location.replace() methods,to set the URL of a new page using the location object.
    - We will discuss each of the property and methods in detail in this tutorial.

## Window.location.replace

    - The first way is to use the window.location.href property.
    - This property contains information about the current URL of the page, and it can be used to redirect the user to a new page.

### Syntax

     window.location.href = "new_url";
    - The user will be immediately redirected to the specified URL (new_url).

    - To redirect the user after a specified amount of time has passed,
      we may also specify the setTimout function which allows the user to redirect
      to the source URL after the time specified in the function.

    setTimeout(function() {
       window.location.href = "https://www.youtube.com";
    }, 2000);

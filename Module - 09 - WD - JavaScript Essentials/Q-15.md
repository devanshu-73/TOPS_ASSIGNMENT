# (Q-15) : What is the use of Void (0)?

    - The void keyword in JavaScript is a unary operator that evaluates
      its operand and always returns the undefined primitive value.
    - Its primary purpose is to create an expression that performs
      an action without returning a value, or to create a shortcut for returning undefined from a function.

## Example :

    <a href="#" onclick="doSomething(); void 0;">Click me</a>

    - we're using void to prevent the browser from navigating to a new page when the link is clicked.
    - The doSomething() function is called, and then void 0 is used to create an expression that evaluates to undefined.

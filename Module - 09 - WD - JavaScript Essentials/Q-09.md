# (Q-9) : How can the style/class of an element be changed?
    - We can change, add or remove any CSS property from an HTML element on 
      the occurrence of any event with the help of JavaScript.
    - There are two common approaches that allow us to achieve this task.

    - (1) style.property
    - (2) Changing the class itself

## Approach 1: Changing CSS with the help of the style property:

### Syntax:
    document.getElementById("id").style.property = new_style


## Approach 2: Changing the class itself

    - The classList Property: The classList is a read-only property that returns the 
      CSS class names of an element as a DOMTokenList object. 

### Syntax:
    document.getElementById("id").classList

    - You can use the below-mentioned methods to add classes, remove classes, and toggle between different classes respectively.

    - The add() method: It adds one or more classes.
    - The remove() method: It removes one or more classes.
    - The toggle() method: If the class does not exist it adds it and returns true. 
      It removes the class and returns false. The second boolean argument forces the class to be added or removed.

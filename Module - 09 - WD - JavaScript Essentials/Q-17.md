# (Q-17) :  What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript? 

Disadvantages of using innerHTML property in JavaScript:

### The use of innerHTML very slow:
    - The process of using innerHTML is much slower as its contents as slowly built, 
      also already parsed contents and elements are also re-parsed which takes time.
### Preserves event handlers attached to any DOM elements: 
    - The event handlers do not get attached to the new elements created by setting innerHTML automatically.
    - To do so one has to keep track of the event handlers and attach it to new elements manually.
    - This may cause a memory leak on some browsers.
### Content is replaced everywhere:
    - Either you add, append, delete or modify contents on a webpage using innerHTML,
      all contents is replaced, also all the DOM nodes inside that element are reparsed and recreated.
### Appending to innerHTML is not supported:
    - Usually, += is used for appending in JavaScript. But on appending to an Html tag using innerHTML, the whole tag is re-parsed.

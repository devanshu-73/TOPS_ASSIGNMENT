# (Q-6) : Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?

    - Javascript is a very important language when it comes to learning how the browser works. Often there are times we would like to add dynamic elements/content to our web pages. This post deals with all of that.

    - Creation of new element: New elements can be created in JS by using the createElement() method.  

### Syntax:

 -     document.createElement("<tagName>");  

          - // Where <tagName> can be any HTML 
          - // tagName like div, ul, button, etc.

 -     // newDiv element has been created
        For Eg: let newDiv = document.createElement("div");

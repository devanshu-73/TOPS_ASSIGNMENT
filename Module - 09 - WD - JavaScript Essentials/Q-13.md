# (Q-13) : What is the function of the delete operator? 
    - The JavaScript pop(), shift(), or splice() methods are available to delete an element from an array.  - But because of the key-value pair in an object, deleting is more complicated.
    - Note that, the delete operator only works on objects and not on variables or functions.

## Syntax:

    delete object
    or
    delete object.property
    or
    delete object['property']

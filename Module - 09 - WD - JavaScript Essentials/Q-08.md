# (Q-8) :  What is === operator?
    - In JavaScript, the === operator is a strict equality comparison operator that returns false 
      for values that are not of a similar type.
    - This operator performs type casting for equality.
    - If we compare 2 with “2” using ===, then it will return a false value.

    - The == operator is an equality operator that checks whether its two operands are 
      the same or not by changing expression from one data type to others.
    - You can use the == operator in order to compare the identity of two operands even
      though they are not of a similar type.

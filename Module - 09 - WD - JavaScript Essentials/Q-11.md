# (Q-11) : What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
    - JavaScript mainly provides three ways for executing the loops.
    - While all the ways provide similar basic functionality, they differ in their syntax and condition-checking time.

## while loop 
    - A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed
      repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.
    - The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement. 

### Syntax

    while (condition) {
        loop statements...
    }


## for loop 
    - for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure.
    - Unlike while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, condition,
      and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy-to-debug structure of looping. 

### Syntax

    for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
        statement(s)
    }

## do-while 
    - The do-while loop is similar to the while loop with the only difference
      is that it checks for the condition after executing the statements,
      and therefore is an example of an Exit Control Loop. 

### Syntax

    do {
        Statements..
    }
    while (condition);

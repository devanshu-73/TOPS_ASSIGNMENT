# (Q - 2) : What are Tags and Attributes in HTML?

## **HTML Tags**
    -  The starting and ending point parts of an HTML document are HTML Tags,
       which start with < (less than) and end with >(greater than) angle bracket, 
       and whatever is written inside the angle brackets are known as tags.

    -  Both opening and closing tags must be there in order to function.

    -  some self enclosing tags which require only one tag such as <hr>, <img>, <br> etc.
       The ending slash over here is optional.
       
       Example Of HTML Tag: <Tagname>.....</Tagname> 

## **HTML Attributes**
    - HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information about the
      elements or attributes are the modifier of the HTML element.

    - Each element or tag can have attributes, which defines the behaviour of that element.
  
    - Attributes should always be applied with start tag.
  
    - The Attribute should always be applied with its name and value pair.
    
    - The Attributes name and values are case sensitive,and it is recommended by 
      W3C that it should be written in Lowercase only.

    - You can add multiple attributes in one HTML element,but need to give space  
      between two attributes.

      Example Of HTML Attributes : <Tagname attribute_name="value">content</Tagname>

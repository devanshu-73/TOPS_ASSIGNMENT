# (Q - 3) : What are void elements in HTML?

    - Most of the HTML elements are surrounded by start and end tags to specify 
      the starting and end of the element.

    - There is a special group of elements that only have start tags and does not contain any content within it, these elements are   
      called void elements. Void elements doesnâ€™t have ending tags and can only have attributes but do not contain any kind of content. 
    - These elements can have backslash before ending of start tag but that is completely optional. 
    
     Example Of Void Elements : <br>, <hr>, <img>, <input>, <link>, <base>, <meta>,
     <param>, <area>, <embed>, <col>, <track>, <source> etc.

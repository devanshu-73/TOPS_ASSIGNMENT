# (Q-07) How to install React Js on Windows, linux Operating System? How to install NPM and How to check version of NPM?
## Installing React.js and npm on Windows:

    - Install Node.js: React.js requires Node.js, which includes npm. You can download the Windows installer from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/

    - Visit the website and download the LTS (Long Term Support) version for Windows.
    - Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
###  Verify Installation:
    - After the installation is complete, open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window and enter the following commands to verify that Node.js and npm have been installed successfully:

    - node -v
    - npm -v

### Create a React App:
    - To create a new React application, you can use the following command in the Command Prompt or PowerShell:

    - npx create-react-app my-react-app
    - 
    - This will create a new directory named my-react-app containing a basic React project.

    - Navigate to the App Directory: Use the following command to navigate to the app directory:

    - cd my-react-app

### Start the Development Server: Start the development server by running:

    - npm start

    - This will start the React development server, and you can access your app in a web browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Installing React.js and npm on Linux:

### Install Node.js:
    - Open a terminal and use the following commands to install Node.js and npm using a package manager appropriate for your Linux distribution. Here, we'll use apt for Ubuntu/Debian-based systems and dnf for Fedora:

### For Ubuntu/Debian:

    - sudo apt update
    - sudo apt install nodejs npm

     - For Fedora:

     - sudo dnf install nodejs npm

    - Verify Installation: After installation, verify that Node.js and npm are installed by running:

    - node -v
    - npm -v

### Create a React App:
    - Follow the same steps as mentioned for Windows to create and navigate to a new React app.

    - Start the Development Server: Similarly, start the development server using:

    - npm start

    - Remember that package manager commands (like apt or dnf) might require administrative privileges, so use sudo as needed.

    - Checking the Version of npm:

    - To check the version of npm, simply open a terminal and run:

    - npm -v

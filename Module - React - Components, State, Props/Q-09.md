# (Q-09) How to change in components of React Js?

## 1. Update in state: 
    - The state change can be from a prop or setState change to update a variable(say).
    - The component gets the updated state and React re-renders the component to reflect the change on the app.
## 2. Update in prop:
    - Likewise the change in prop leads to state change and state change leads to re-rendering of the component by React.
## 3. Re-rendering of parent component:
    - Whenever the components render function is called, all its subsequent child components will re-render, regardless of whether their props have changed or not.

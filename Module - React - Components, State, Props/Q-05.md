# (Q-05) What is Components in React Js?

    - Components are independent and reusable bits of code.
    - They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

    - Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.

##  Function Component
    - Here is the same example as above, but created using a Function component instead.

    - A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, but Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand, and will be preferred in this tutorial.

### Example
    - Create a Function component called Car

    - function Car() {
            return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
                     }


## Class Component
    - A class component must include the extends React.Component statement. This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

    - The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.

### Example
    - Create a Class component called Car

    - class Car extends React.Component {
           render() {
                return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
                    }
            }

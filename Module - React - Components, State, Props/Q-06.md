# (Q-06) What is Header and Content Components in React Js? 

## Header Component:
    - The Header component typically represents the top section of a web page or an application.
    - It often contains elements like the site's logo, navigation menus, user profile information, and any other content that you want to display consistently at the top of the page.
    - The Header component is reusable across different pages or sections of your application, allowing you to maintain a consistent look and feel throughout.
    
### Example 
    import React from 'react';

    const Header = () => {
    return (
        <header>
        <nav>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
        </header>
    );
    };

    export default Header;


## Content Component:
    - The Content component is a more generic term used to describe the main section of a web page or an application.
    - It's where the primary content or functionality of the page is displayed.
    - This could include text, images, forms, lists, or any other type of content that makes up the core of the page's purpose.
    - Content components are often designed to be flexible and reusable, allowing you to swap out different content while keeping the same layout and structure.

    import React from 'react';

    const Content = () => {
    return (
        <div className="content">
        <h1>Welcome to Our Website</h1>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit...</p>
        {/* Additional content elements */}
        </div>
    );
    };

    export default Content;

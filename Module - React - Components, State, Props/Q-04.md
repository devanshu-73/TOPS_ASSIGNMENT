# (Q-04) What is CLI command In React Js?

    - React have its own CLI but currently they are only supporting creating an app (create-react-app). 
    - create-react-app used to generate the boilerplate version of a React application thru command line.

    - npx create-react-app my-app or npm create-react-app my-app 

    - create-react-app has taken care of setting up the main structure of the application as well as a couple of developer settings.
    - Most of what you see will not be visible to the visitor of your web app.
    - React uses a tool called webpack which transforms the directories and files here into static assets. 
    - Visitors to your site are served those static assets.

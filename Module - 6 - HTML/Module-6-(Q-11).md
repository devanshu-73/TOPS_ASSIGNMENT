# (Q - 11) : What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?

    - The inline and block elements of HTML are one of the important areas where web developers often 
      get confused because they were unable to know which are inline and block elements which may cause
      clumsiness in a webpage in case he assumes some element to be a block but it is an inline element 
      which causes next element comes next to it.

    - So let us see the differences between the inline and block elements in HTML and 
      the different frequently used inline and block HTML elements. 

## Block elements 
    - They consume the entire width available irrespective of their sufficiency.
    - They always start in a new line and have top and bottom margins.
    - It does not contain any other elements next to it.

## Example Of Block Element
 -     <h1>-<h6> : This element is used for including    headings of different sizes ranging from 1 to 6.
 -     <div>: This is a container tag and is used to make separate divisions of content on the web page.
 -     <hr>: This is an empty tag and is used for separating content by horizontal lines.
 -     <li>: This tag is used for including list items of an ordered or unordered list.
 -     <ul>: This tag is used to make an unordered list.
 -     <ol>: This tag is used to make an ordered list.
 -     <p>: This tag is used to include paragraphs of content in the webpage.
 -     <table>: This tag is used for including the tables in the webpage when there is a need for tabular data.
 

## Inline elements: 
     - Inline elements occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows other elements next to it which are inline.
     - Inline elements don’t start from a new line and don’t have top and bottom margins as block elements have.

 -      <span>:  This is an inline container that takes necessary space only.
 -      <b>:  This tag is used in places where bold text is needed.
 -      <label>: The tag in HTML is used to provide a usability improvement for mouse users i.e, if a user 
        clicks on the text within the <label> element, it toggles the control.

# (Q - 19) : HTML vs XHTML?

## What is HTML?
    HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to create websites and web applications. Let’s break it down, so we understand the name better:

    Hypertext: 
    - Hypertext refers to the “text wrapped within a text.”
    - It is very similar to hyperlinks and contains an underlying text that, when clicked, redirects to a new webpage.

    Markup language :
    - A markup language is not necessarily a programming language.
    - Instead, it is used to apply formatting and layout to a simple text document. This leads to more interactive and dynamic text content.


## What is XHTML?
    - XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language
    - XHTML is almost similar to HTML but it is stricter than HTML
    - It is swift, accurate, easily maintained, convertible, and formatted
    - All major browsers support XHTML

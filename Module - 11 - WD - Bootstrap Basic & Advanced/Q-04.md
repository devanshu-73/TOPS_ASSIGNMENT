# (Q-4) : What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?

## Grid System :

    - Bootstrap Grid System allows up to 12 columns across the page.
    - You can use each of them individually or merge them together for wider columns. You can use all combinations of values summing up to 12.
    - You can use 12 columns each of width 1, or use 4 columns each of width 3 or any other combination.

## Grid Classes :

### The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:

    - xs (for phones - screens less than 768px wide)
    - sm (for tablets - screens equal to or greater than 768px wide)
    - md (for small laptops - screens equal to or greater than 992px wide)
    - lg (for laptops and desktops - screens equal to or greater than 1200px wide)

## Grid System Rules :

### Some Bootstrap grid system rules :

    - Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding
    - Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns
    - Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows
    - Predefined classes like .row and .col-sm-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts
    - Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows
    - Grid columns are created by specifying the number of 12 available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-sm-4
    - Column widths are in percentage, so they are always fluid and sized relative to their parent element

# (Q - 10) : Why should background and color be used as separate properties?

    - Separating background and color as independent properties allows 
      for more flexibility and control in styling elements within a user interface or a web page.
    - The background refers to the area behind an element, 
      such as the background color or an image applied to it,
      while the color refers to the foreground color of the text or the element itself. 
    - By keeping them separate, you can easily distinguish between the two and apply distinct styles to each, 
      ensuring good visual contrast and readability.

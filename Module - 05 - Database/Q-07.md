# (Q-07) : What is DML Compiler in SQL?

## Ans : Here are the key components involved in processing DML operations in a SQL database system:

### Query Processor:

    - The query processor is responsible for interpreting and executing SQL queries and DML statements. It includes various subcomponents, such as the query optimizer, which determines the most efficient way to retrieve or manipulate data.

### Execution Engine:

    - The execution engine is responsible for actually executing the DML statements. It interacts with the storage engine to read and write data from and to the underlying storage.

### Storage Engine:

    - The storage engine manages the physical storage of data on the storage media. It handles tasks like data retrieval and storage and ensures data consistency.

### Transaction Manager:

    - The transaction manager ensures that DML operations follow the principles of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). It manages transactions and handles issues like concurrent access and data integrity.

### Query Cache:

    - In some database systems, there is a query cache that stores the results of frequently executed DML statements to improve query performance.

### Lock Manager:

    - The lock manager is responsible for managing locks on data to prevent conflicts between concurrent DML operations.

### Buffer Manager:

    - The buffer manager caches frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the need for disk I/O during DML operations.

### Log Manager:

    - The log manager records changes made by DML operations in a transaction log, which is used for recovery and rollback in case of failures.

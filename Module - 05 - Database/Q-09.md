# (Q-09) : What is save Point? How to create a save Point write a Query?

## Ans :

    - To create a savepoint and use it within a SQL query, you typically need to use the SQL statements provided by your database management system (DBMS).
    - The specific syntax can vary between different database systems, but I'll provide a general example using SQL:

### Create a Savepoint:

    - You can create a savepoint within a transaction using the SAVEPOINT statement. For example:

    - SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;

    - This statement creates a savepoint named "my_savepoint" within the current transaction.

### Perform Some Actions:

    - Execute various SQL statements as part of your transaction.

### Rollback to the Savepoint:

    - If you want to roll back to the savepoint due to an error or any other reason, you can use the ROLLBACK TO statement.

#### For example:

    - ROLLBACK TO my_savepoint;
    - This will undo all changes made since the savepoint was created.

### Commit or Rollback the Transaction:

    - After you've made all the necessary changes, you can either commit the transaction to make the changes permanent or roll back the entire transaction to discard all changes. Here are the commands for both:

### To commit the transaction:

    - COMMIT;

### To roll back the entire transaction:

    - ROLLBACK;

# (Q-02) :  What is Normalization? 

## Ans :
    - Normalization in the context of a Database Management System (DBMS) refers to the process of organizing data in a relational database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
    - The primary goal of normalization is to eliminate data anomalies that can occur when data is duplicated or stored in an unstructured manner.
    - This is achieved by breaking down large, complex tables into smaller, related tables, and by defining relationships between them.

    - Normalization is typically carried out by applying a set of rules called Normal Forms.
    - The most commonly used normal forms are the first normal form (1NF), second normal form (2NF), third normal form (3NF), Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF), and fourth normal form (4NF).
    - Each normal form has specific criteria that a database table must meet to be considered in that form.

### Here's a brief overview of some of the key normal forms:

## First Normal Form (1NF): 
    - A table is in 1NF if it does not contain repeating groups or arrays, and each column contains only atomic (indivisible) values.

## Second Normal Form (2NF): 
    - A table is in 2NF if it's in 1NF, and all non-key attributes are functionally dependent on the entire primary key. This form is mainly concerned with eliminating partial dependencies.

## Third Normal Form (3NF): 
    - A table is in 3NF if it's in 2NF and all transitive dependencies are removed. Transitive dependencies occur when a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute, which itself depends on the primary key.

## Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):
    - BCNF is a more stringent form of normalization that further eliminates anomalies by ensuring that non-key attributes are functionally dependent only on the primary key.

## Fourth Normal Form (4NF):
    - 4NF deals with multi-valued dependencies. A table is in 4NF when it is in BCNF and has no multi-valued dependencies.

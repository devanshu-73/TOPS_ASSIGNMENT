# (Q-10) : What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?

## Ans :

    - In SQL, a trigger is a database object that is associated with a table and is automatically executed in response to certain events or actions, such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or other data manipulation operations performed on the table.
    - Triggers are used to enforce referential integrity, perform logging, and automate tasks in response to data changes.

### Example :

    CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER log_changes
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE
    ON employees
    FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
        IF INSERTING THEN
            INSERT INTO employee_audit (employee_id, action, action_date)
            VALUES (:NEW.employee_id, 'INSERT', SYSDATE);
        ELSIF UPDATING THEN
            INSERT INTO employee_audit (employee_id, action, action_date)
            VALUES (:NEW.employee_id, 'UPDATE', SYSDATE);
        ELSIF DELETING THEN
            INSERT INTO employee_audit (employee_id, action, action_date)
            VALUES (:OLD.employee_id, 'DELETE', SYSDATE);
        END IF;
    END;


    - In this example, the trigger log_changes is created to log changes made to the employees table.
    - The trigger is set to execute AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on the table. It logs the changes into an employee_audit table.

# (Q-08) : What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints?

## Ans :

    - SQL key constraints are rules or conditions applied to database columns to ensure the integrity and uniqueness of data.
    - There are three primary types of key constraints in SQL: Primary Key, Unique Key, and Foreign Key.

### Primary Key (PK):

    - A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
    - It enforces the uniqueness and integrity of data in that table.
    - The primary key constraint also implies that the column(s) cannot contain NULL values.

## Example of creating a table with a primary key constraint:

    CREATE TABLE Students (
        StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        FirstName VARCHAR(50),
        LastName VARCHAR(50)
    );

    - In this example, the "StudentID" column is specified as the primary key for the "Students" table.
    - It will ensure that each student has a unique ID, and NULL values are not allowed.

### Unique Key (UNIQUE Constraint):

    - A unique key constraint enforces the uniqueness of values in a column or a set of columns, but it allows for NULL values. It's used to ensure that a column or a combination of columns has no duplicate values.

## Example of creating a table with a unique key constraint:

    CREATE TABLE Products (
        ProductID INT UNIQUE,
        ProductName VARCHAR(100)
    );

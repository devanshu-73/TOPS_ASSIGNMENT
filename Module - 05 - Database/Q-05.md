# (Q-05) : What do you understand By Data Redundancy?

    - Data redundancy refers to the situation in which the same data is stored in multiple places within a database or across multiple databases in a system.
    - It occurs when there is unnecessary duplication of data, and it can have several negative consequences. Data redundancy is typically considered undesirable in database design and management for several reasons:

## Wasted Storage:

    - Storing the same data multiple times consumes additional storage space. This can lead to increased storage costs and inefficient use of resources.

## Data Inconsistency:

    - When the same data is stored in multiple locations, it becomes challenging to ensure that all copies of the data remain consistent. - Changes made to one copy of the data may not be reflected in others, leading to data inconsistencies and inaccuracies.

## Data Update Anomalies:

    - Data redundancy can result in update anomalies. For example, if the same customer's address is stored in multiple records and needs to be updated, it must be changed in multiple places.
    - Failure to update all occurrences can lead to discrepancies in the data.

## Increased Maintenance Complexity:

    - Managing and maintaining redundant data is more complex and time-consuming.
    - Database administrators must ensure that all copies of the data remain synchronized.

## Data Retrieval Challenges:

    - Redundant data can make data retrieval more complex and slower.
    - It can require more processing and potentially result in inconsistent query results.

## Security Risks:

    - Redundant data can pose security risks.
    - Unauthorized access to one copy of the data may lead to unauthorized access to other copies.
    - Ensuring consistent security across all copies of the data is challenging.

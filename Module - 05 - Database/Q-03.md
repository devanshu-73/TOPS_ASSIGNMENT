# (Q-03) : What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

## Ans :

    - A Database Management System (DBMS) and a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) are both software systems used to manage databases, but they have some key differences. Here's a table outlining the main distinctions between the two:

| Feature                        | DBMS                                                                                                                 | RDBMS                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Model                     | Supports various data models like hierarchical, network, or object-oriented, in addition to relational.              | Strictly adheres to the relational data model, where data is organized into tables with rows and columns.                         |
| Data Storage                   | Can use various data storage methods, including flat files and non-relational databases.                             | Data is stored in structured tables with predefined schemas.                                                                      |
| Data Structure                 | Data can be organized in a less structured manner, which can lead to data redundancy and inconsistencies.            | Data is organized in a highly structured manner, which reduces redundancy and enforces data integrity.                            |
| Data Retrieval and Querying    | Querying and data retrieval can be less efficient due to the lack of structured relationships between data elements. | Provides efficient querying using SQL (Structured Query Language) with JOIN operations to establish relationships between tables. |
| Data Integrity and Constraints | Lacks strict data integrity constraints and foreign key relationships.                                               | Enforces data integrity through primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.                                                |
| Scalability and Performance    | Tends to have lower performance and scalability, especially for complex and large datasets.                          | Generally offers better performance and scalability for handling large and complex datasets.                                      |
| ACID Compliance                | May not fully support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.                               | Typically fully supports ACID properties, ensuring data consistency and reliability.                                              |
| Examples                       | File-based systems, NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB), hierarchical databases (e.g., IBM IMS).                         | Popular RDBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and SQLite.                                                         |

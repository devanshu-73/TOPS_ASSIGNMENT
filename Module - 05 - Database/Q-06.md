# (Q-06) : What is DDL Interpreter?

    - The DDL interpreter's primary function is to manage the database schema, which includes defining the structure of the database, creating and altering tables, specifying constraints, and establishing relationships between tables. Here are some common DDL commands and operations that a DDL interpreter handles:

## CREATE TABLE:

    - DDL interpreters process the CREATE TABLE statement to define the structure of database tables, including column names, data types, and constraints such as primary keys and foreign keys.

## ALTER TABLE:

    - They handle ALTER TABLE statements for making changes to an existing table, such as adding or dropping columns, modifying column definitions, or adding constraints.

## DROP TABLE:

    - DDL interpreters execute the DROP TABLE statement to remove a table and its associated data from the database.

## CREATE INDEX:

    - They process CREATE INDEX statements to create indexes on specific columns for improving query performance.

## DROP INDEX:

    - DDL interpreters execute DROP INDEX statements to remove indexes from the database.

## CREATE VIEW:

    - DDL interpreters manage CREATE VIEW statements, which define virtual tables based on the data from one or more physical tables.

## CREATE DATABASE:

    - They handle CREATE DATABASE statements to create new databases within the DBMS.

## ALTER DATABASE:

    - DDL interpreters may also process ALTER DATABASE statements to modify database-level settings.

## DROP DATABASE:

    - They execute DROP DATABASE statements to delete entire databases.

## Other Schema-Related Operations:

    - DDL interpreters are responsible for enforcing various constraints (e.g., UNIQUE, CHECK), defining stored procedures and triggers, and managing user permissions and access control.

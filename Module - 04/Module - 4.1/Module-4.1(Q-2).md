# **What is OOP? List OOP concepts.**
    - OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
    - Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.
    - Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
    - OOP is faster and easier to execute
    - OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
    - OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself",makes the code easier to maintain,modify and debug
    - OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
  
## **Object Oriented Programming(OOP)**
    - In Object oriented programming we write programs using classes and objects utilising features of OOPs 
      such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism

   ### **Class and Objects**
    - A class is like a blueprint of data member and functions.
    - object is an instance of class. 
    - For example, lets say we have a class Car which has data members (variables) such as speed, weight, price and functions such as gearChange(), slowDown(), brake() etc. 
    - Now lets say I create a object of this class named FordFigo which uses these data members and functions and give them its own values.
    - Similarly we can create as many objects as we want using the blueprint(class).

### **Abstraction**
    - Abstraction is a process of hiding irrelevant details from user. For example, When you send an sms you just type the message, select the contact and click send, the phone shows you that the message has been sent,
    what actually happens in background when you click send is hidden from you as it is not relevant to you.

### **Encapsulation**
    - Encapsulation is a process of combining data and function into a single unit like capsule. This is to avoid the access of private data members from outside the class.
    - To achieve encapsulation, we make all data members of class private and create public functions, using them we can get the values from these data members or set the value to these data members.

### **Inheritance**
    - Inheritance is a feature using which an object of child class acquires the properties of parent class.

### **Polymorphism**
    - Function overloading and Operator overloading are examples of polymorphism.
    - Polymorphism is a feature using which an object behaves differently in different situation.

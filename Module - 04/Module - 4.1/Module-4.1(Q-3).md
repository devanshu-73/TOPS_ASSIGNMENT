# **Difference between OOP and POP :**

| OOP                                                  | POP                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Object oriented.                                     | Structure oriented.                                    |
| Program is divided into objects.                     | Program is divided into functions.                     |
| Bottom-up approach.                                  | Top-down approach.                                     |
| Inheritance property is used                         | Inheritance is not allowed.                            |
| It uses access specifier.                            | It doesnâ€™t use access specifier.                       |
| Encapsulation is used to hide the data.              | No data hiding.                                        |
| Concept of virtual function.                         | No virtual function.                                   |
| Object functions are linked through message passing. | Parts of program are linked through parameter passing. |
| Adding new data and functions is easy                | Expanding new data and functions is not easy.          |
| The existing code can be reused.                     | No code reusability.                                   |
| use for solving big problems.                        | Not suitable for solving big problems.                 |
| C++, Java.                                           | C, Pascal.                                             |

# (Q - 1) : Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing ?
    - HTML elements and tags are a lot different.

## **HTML Tags**
    -  The starting and ending point parts of an HTML document are HTML Tags,
       which start with < (less than) and end with >(greater than) angle bracket, 
       and whatever is written inside the angle brackets are known as tags.

    -  Both opening and closing tags must be there in order to function.
    -  some self enclosing tags which require only one tag such as <hr>, <img>, <br> etc.
       The ending slash over here is optional.
       
       Example Of HTML Tag: <Tagname>.....</Tagname> 


## **HTML Elements**
    - Elements are content in between the tags.
    - It consists of an expression or a structure.
    - Its architecture consists of a start tag, content followed by an ending tag.
    
      Example Of HTML Element: <p> This is the content. </p>

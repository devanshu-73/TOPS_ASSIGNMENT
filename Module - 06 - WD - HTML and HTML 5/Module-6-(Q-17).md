# (Q - 17) : What are the different tags to separate sections of text?

     1. <p></p>: This is used for paragraphs. Whenever you want to separate two or more paragraphs, this tag can be used.

     2. <div></div>: This can also be used to separate the blocks of text. But this tag defines a division on the page. Generally used to form divisions for either a banner or logo or something related to that on HTML page.

     3. <hr>: Horizontal line tag can be used to separate the paragraphs (or lines) in the HTML file.

     4. <br>: Line break tag can also perform the same purpose. It is generally used to start a text on a new line in HTML.

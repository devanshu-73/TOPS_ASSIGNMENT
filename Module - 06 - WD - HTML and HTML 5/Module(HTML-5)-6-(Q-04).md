# (Q - 4) : SVG and CANVAS in HTML-5?
## SVG:-

    - The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based image format that is used to define two-dimensional vector-based graphics for the web.
    - Unlike raster image (Ex .jpg, .gif, .png, etc.), a vector image can be scaled up or down to any extent without losing the image quality.

    - An SVG image is drawn out using a series of statements that follow the XML schema â€” that means SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, such as Notepad.
    - There are several other advantages of using SVG 
    over other image formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc.

## Canvas:-

    - The HTML element is used to draw graphics on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).
    - The element is only a container for graphics.
    - You must use a script to actually draw the graphics.
    - Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

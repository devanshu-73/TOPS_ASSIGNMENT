# (Q - 4) : What are HTML Entities?

    - If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.
      Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.

    - A character entity looks like this:
        &entity_name;
        OR
        &#entity_number;

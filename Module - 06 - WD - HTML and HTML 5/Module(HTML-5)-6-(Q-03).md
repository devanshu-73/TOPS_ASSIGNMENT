# (Q - 3) : Semantic element in html5?

## List of new semantic elements :

### The semantic elements added in HTML5 are:

    <article>
    <aside>
    <details>
    <figcaption>
    <figure>
    <footer>
    <header>
    <main>
    <mark>
    <nav>
    <section>
    <summary>
    <time>

    - Elements such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer> act more or less like <div> elements.
    - They group other elements together into page sections.
    - However where a <div> tag could contain any type of information, it is easy to identify what sort of information would go in a semantic <header> region.

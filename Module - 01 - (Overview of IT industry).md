# Module 1 : (Overview of IT Industry)

## **1. What is software? What is software engineering?**

    - SOFTWARE :Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers
    and execute specific tasks. It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer. Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device. It can be thought of as the variable part of a computer, while hardware is the invariable part.

    - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING : Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software.
    It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software.
    Software engineering includes a variety of techniques, tools, and methodologies, including requirements analysis, design, testing, and maintenance.

### -> Some key principles of software engineering include:

    - Modularity: Breaking the software into smaller, reusable components that can be developed and tested independently.
    - Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details of a component and exposing only the necessary functionality to other parts of the software.
    - Encapsulation: Wrapping up the data and functions of an object into a single unit, and protecting the internal state of an object from external modifications.
    - Reusability: Creating components that can be used in multiple projects, which can save time and resources.
    - Maintenance: Regularly updating and improving the software to fix bugs, add new features, and address security vulnerabilities.
    - Testing: Verifying that the software meets its requirements and is free of bugs.
    - Design Patterns: Solving recurring problems in software design by providing templates for solving them.
    - Agile methodologies: Using iterative and incremental development processes that focus on customer satisfaction, rapid delivery, and flexibility.

## **2. Explain Types of software.**

    The two main categories of software are  system software and application software.

    -> System Software :

    1. General-purpose software that manages basic system resources and processes
    2. Written in low-level assembly language or machine code
    3. Must meet specific hardware needs; interacts closely with hardware
    4. Installed at the same time as the OS, usually by the manufacturer
    5. Runs any time the computer is on
    6. Works in the background and users don't usually access it
    7. Is necessary for the system to function

    -> Application Software :

    1. Software that performs specific tasks to meest user needs
    2. Written in higher-level languages, such as Python and JavaScript
    3. Does not take hardware into account and doesn't interact directly with hardware
    4. User or admin installs software when needed
    5. User triggers and stops the program
    6. Runs in the foreground and users work directly with the software to performs specific tasks
    7. Needs system software to run
    8. Isn't needed for the system to funtion

## **3. What is SDLC? Explain Each phase of SDLC.**

    - Software Development is the development of software for distinct purposes. For software development, there is a specific programming language
    like Java, Python, C/C++, etc.The entire process of software development isn’t as simple as its definition, it’s a complicated process.
    Accordingly, it requires an efficient approach from the developer in the form of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

    - Proper planning and execution are the key components of a successful software development process. The entire software development process
    includes 6 stages. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the common term to summarize these 6 stages.

    -> SDLC specifies the task(s) to be performed at various stages by a software engineer/developer. It ensures that the end product is able to
    meet the customer’s expectations and fits in the overall budget. Hence, it’s vital for a software developer to have prior knowledge of this
    software development process.

### - **These 6 stages are discussed below.**

**• Stage-1: Planning And Requirement Analysis:**

    - Planning is the crucial step in everything and so as in software development. In this same stage, requirement analysis is also performed by the developers of the organization. This is attained from the inputs from the customers, sales department/market surveys.

    - The information from this analysis forms the building block of a basic project. The quality proof of the project is a result of planning. Thus, in this stage, the basic project is designed with all the available information.

**• Stage-2: Defining Requirements:**

    - In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are specified. These requirements get approval from the customers, market analysts, and stakeholders.

    - This is fulfilled by utilizing SRS (Software Requirement Specification). This is a sort of document that specifies all those things that need to be defined and created during the entire project cycle.

**• Stage-3: Designing Architecture:**

    - SRS is a reference for software designers to come out with the best architecture for the software. Hence, with the requirements defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are present in the Design Document Specification (DDS).

    - This DDS is assessed by market analysts and stakeholders. After evaluating all the possible factors, the most practical and logical design is chosen for the development.

**• Stage-4: Developing Product:**

    - At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design in the DDS. Hence, it is important for the coders to follow the protocols set by the association.

    - Conventional programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are also put into use at this stage.
    Some popular languages like C/C++, Python, Java, etc. are put into use as per the software regulations.

**• Stage-5: Product Testing and Integration:**

    - After the development of the product, testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution. Although, minimal testing is conducted at every stage of SDLC.

    - Therefore, at this stage, all the probable flaws are tracked, fixed, and retested. This ensures that the product confronts the quality requirements of SRS.

**• Stage 6: Deployment and Maintenance Of Product:**

    - After detailed testing, the conclusive product is released in phases as per the organization’s strategy. Then it is tested in a real industrial environment. Because it is important to ensure its smooth performance.

    - If it performs well, the organization sends out the product as a whole. After retrieving beneficial feedback, the company releases it as it is or with auxiliary improvements to make it further helpful for the customers. However, this alone is not enough. Therefore, along with the deployment, the product’s supervision.

## **4.What is DFD? Create a DFD diagram on flipcart.**

    - DFD is the abbreviation for Data Flow Diagram. The flow of data of a system or a process is represented by DFD.

    - It also gives insight into the inputs and outputs of each entity and the process itself.

    - DFD does not have control flow and no loops or decision rules are present.

    - Specific operations depending on the type of data can be explained by a flowchart.

    - It is a graphical tool, useful for communicating with users ,managers and other personnel.

    - It is useful for analysing existing as well as proposed system.

### - It provides an overview of

    - What data is system processes.
    - What transformation are performed.
    - What data are stored.
    - What results are produced , etc.

## **5. What is Flow chart? Create a flowchart to make addition of two numbers.**

    - Flowcharts are nothing but the graphical representation of the data or the algorithm for a better understanding of the code visually.

    - It displays step-by-step solutions to a problem, algorithm, or process. It is a pictorial way of representing steps that are preferred by most beginner-level programmers to understand algorithms of computer science, thus it contributes to troubleshooting the issues in the algorithm.

    - A flowchart is a picture of boxes that indicates the process flow in a sequential manner.

    - Since a flowchart is a pictorial representation of a process or algorithm, it’s easy to interpret and understand the process.

    - To draw a flowchart, certain rules need to be followed which are followed by all professionals to draw a flowchart and is widely accepted all over the countries.

## **6. What is Use case Diagram? Create a use-case on bill payment on paytm.**

    - A use case diagram is a visual summarization of interactions and relationships within a system.
    These diagrams show a very broad view of a system. They may show systems in computer software, businesses or customer experiences.

    - A use case diagram shows a model scenario in which individuals interact with a system using a series of specialized symbols and connectors.

### **What is involved in a use case diagram?**

    - A case use diagram includes a few key components:

    1. Actors: Actors are individuals who have a relationship within the system. They interact with each step of the process. This may include users, customers, clients or employees Actors may interact with the system internally or externally.

    2. Use cases: Use cases, often represented by an oval or circle encompassing text, describe a system function that is an actor or person can start or use. This function may be automatic or manual and may link to an actor or function independently.

    3. Communication links: A solid, straight line can represent an actor's interaction with a use case or use cases' interactions.

    4. Associations: Association links represent interactions between actors and use cases.

    5. Generalizations: Generalization links represent relationships between actors that depend on each other's functions to complete their role within a system.

    6. Extensions: Extension links represent optional functions within a system. These links may connect actors to use cases or multiple related use cases without depending on one another for functionality.

    7. Inclusions: Inclusion links represent additional functions necessary to complete a system and may form connections between two use cases or use cases and actors.

    8. System boundary: The system boundary is a visual limitation of the entire system module. For complex systems, there may be many system boundaries that represent smaller, more specific modules. For example, a business use case diagram may have system boundaries for smaller components, such as marketing, sales and accounting.
